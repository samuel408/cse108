        <p class="summary">
            The story of cars begins much earlier than the sleek machines we know today. In 1672, a steam-powered "carriage" chugged through China, the first self-propelled vehicle ever built. Over the next century, inventors experimented with electric and internal combustion engines, paving the way for the true "horseless carriage."
    
    In 1886, Karl Benz in Germany and Gottlieb Daimler in France independently launched the first gasoline-powered automobiles, marking the birth of the modern car. These early vehicles were noisy, unreliable, and expensive, but they sparked a revolution. By the early 20th century, mass production pioneers like Henry Ford's Model T made cars affordable for the masses, transforming personal transportation and society itself.
    
    Innovation continued, with electric starters, disc brakes, and automatic transmissions improving comfort and safety. World War II saw cars repurposed for military use, accelerating technological advancements. Post-war, sleek designs and powerful engines defined the "American Dream" on wheels, exemplified by the iconic Cadillac and Chevrolet.
    
    The 1970s brought concerns about fuel efficiency and safety, leading to smaller, more fuel-efficient cars and stricter regulations. Japanese manufacturers like Toyota and Honda emerged as leaders in quality and fuel economy. As environmental awareness grew, hybrid and electric vehicles like the Prius gained traction in the late 20th century.
    
    Today, the automotive industry faces new challenges â€“ autonomous driving, connected cars, and sustainability. Electric vehicles are rapidly gaining market share, driven by concerns about climate change and advancements in battery technology. The future of cars promises to be exciting, with innovation focused on cleaner, safer, and more connected driving experiences.
